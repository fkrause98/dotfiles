# dotfiles

This repo contains my configuration files for the programs I use, managed with nix through home-manager.

## Install:
Simply run the install.sh and wait for it to finish (more info in home_manager.md)
This will also install doom emacs and sym-link the config.
## Adding programs:
To add a program, add a nix pkg to the home.nix file.
